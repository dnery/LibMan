## Still to be done:

### *Formatter*
* Tweak user listings
* Tweak book listings
* Loan listings

### *Shell*
* Change "loan" and "return" commands grammar to something more practical

### *Database* and *Tables*
* Propagate naming convention from *Shell* commands to attributes and methods

**Actual README file with command grammar instructions!**
